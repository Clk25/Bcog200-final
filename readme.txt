This project will consist in the creation of a sudoku a=bot that can solve puzzles automatically given the input as a list. The list will contain sublists corresponding ot each row with empty squares represented as (-1). The program will check new integers (1-9) into each empty square and make sure the puzzle has a valid solution. Next it will continue trying numbers until it generates a guess which will then be checked for validity before becoming the final solution.
