To test the Sudoku Solver application comprehensively, start by ensuring Python and Tkinter are installed on your system. 
Begin the test by launching the application and inputting a known solvable Sudoku puzzle into the graphical interface. A suitable puzzle for this test might consist of a grid partially filled with numbers where only valid moves are present. After entering the numbers, press the "Solve" button and verify that the application correctly solves the puzzle, filling all empty spaces accurately.
Next, test the application’s handling of unsolvable puzzles by entering a grid that includes deliberate conflicts, such as two identical numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 block. Attempt to solve this puzzle and expect the application to notify you that no solution exists, confirming its ability to detect unsolvable conditions.
Finally, test the input validation feature by entering invalid data, such as alphabetic characters or numbers outside the range of 1-9, into any cell of the grid. The application should immediately alert you about the invalid input, preventing any further solving attempts. This comprehensive testing approach will ensure that all major functionalities of the Sudoku Solver—input handling, puzzle solving, unsolvability detection, and input validation—are operating correctly.
