If a user wanted to test the functionality of this program for either creating a solution or determining validity of a puzzle they could do the following:
Input the puzzle in the appropriate format (ie  using a lists with sublists for each row with empty spaces as -1. So for example one sublist(or row) should look like [[9, 4, -1, -1, 8, 5, -1, -1, 1] with nine total sublists)
if the puzzle is invalid and the program return false than it is functioning correctly and vice versa for valid. 
If the puzzle is correctly determined as valid and the solution makes sense following the syntax of a sudoku puzzle than it works and if not it doesn't
