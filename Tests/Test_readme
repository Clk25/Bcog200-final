To test the Sudoku Solver application comprehensively, start by ensuring Python Tkinter and pytest are installed on your system.
When you use Test.py from this folder please be sure to run it through python in command prompt by typing "python .\test.py" once you have navigated to the correct directory.
If you wanted to test the functioning of the individual functions puzzle_vallidity, next_blank, and valid_move open the file test.py in this directory and run. Feel free to change the example grids as desired to ensure the flexibility of the functions.
In the default grid layouts provided the correct output should be four print statments, the first two should be true and false (indicating a valid and invalid puzzle respectively). 
The next two outputs if functioning at default should be "Next empty cell: (8, 0)" and "Is move valid (3 at (8,0)): True" Again feel free to chaneg the example grids to test the flexibility.
For a manual test of the error detection capabilities start by launching the application and inputting a known solvable Sudoku puzzle into the graphical interface. A suitable puzzle for this test might consist of a grid partially filled with numbers where only valid moves are present. After entering the numbers, press the "Solve" button and verify that the application correctly solves the puzzle, filling all empty spaces accurately.
Next, test the application’s handling of unsolvable puzzles by entering a grid that includes deliberate conflicts, such as two identical numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 block. Attempt to solve this puzzle and expect the application to notify you that no solution exists, confirming its ability to detect unsolvable conditions.
Finally, test the input validation feature by entering invalid data, such as alphabetic characters or numbers outside the range of 1-9, into any cell of the grid. The application should immediately alert you about the invalid input, preventing any further solving attempts. This comprehensive testing approach will ensure that all major functionalities of the Sudoku Solver—input handling, puzzle solving, unsolvability detection, and input validation—are operating correctly.
